## Submitting pull requests

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews. If you don't you'll probably just be asked to
anyway.**

- Please rebase your branch against the current master.
- Run the `Setup` command to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date.
- Please ensure the test suite passes before submitting a PR.
- If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behavior.
- Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/kairo-sh/kairo-ui/issues) on PR comment.

## Submitting bug reports

- Search through issues to see if a previous issue has already been reported and/or fixed.
- Provide a _small_ reproduction using a [StackBlitz project](https://stackblitz.com) or a GitHub repository.
- Please detail the affected browser(s) and operating system(s).
- Please be sure to state which version of Angular, node and npm you're using.

## Submitting new features

- We value keeping the API surface small and concise, which factors into whether new features are accepted.
- The feature will be discussed and considered.
- Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and merged once approved.

## Questions and requests for support

Questions and requests for support should not be opened as issues and should be handled in the following ways:

- Start a new [Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/kairo-sh/kairo-ui/discussions/categories/q-a) on GitHub.

## Commit message guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the changelog**.

### Commit message format

For the commit message format please refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
